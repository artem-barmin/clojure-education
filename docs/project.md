**Project Name:** Interactive Clojure Learning Platform

**Project Overview:**
This project involves developing an interactive web-based platform dedicated to teaching Clojure programming. The platform will provide an environment where users can learn Clojure through interactive lessons, coding exercises, and real-time code evaluation. The platform aims to be user-friendly for beginners yet robust enough for advanced learners to deepen their understanding of Clojure.

**Key Features:**

1. **Interactive Lessons and Tutorials:**
   - **Content Structure:** Lessons structured around core Clojure concepts such as immutability, functional programming, and concurrency. Each lesson will be followed by example code and interactive exercises.
   - **Progress Tracking:** Users can track their progress through different modules, with checkpoints that assess understanding and unlock more advanced topics.

2. **Live Coding Environment:**
   - **In-browser REPL:** A browser-based Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) where users can write Clojure code and see the effects of their code immediately. This REPL will support syntax highlighting and basic code completion.
   - **Code Sandbox:** Users can experiment with Clojure code in a sandbox environment that allows them to test snippets without affecting their main exercise progress.

3. **Exercise and Problem Solving:**
   - **Interactive Coding Challenges:** Exercises that require users to write Clojure code to solve specific problems, reinforcing learning through practice.
   - **Automated Feedback System:** Upon submitting code, the system will automatically evaluate it and provide feedback. If the solution is incorrect, hints or suggestions are offered to guide the learner to the correct solution.

4. **Advanced Topics and Project-Based Learning:**
   - **Project Simulations:** Advanced users can tackle larger, project-based challenges that simulate real-world software development scenarios, using Clojure for tasks such as data manipulation, API integration, and full-stack web development.
   - **Community Contributions:** Allow users to submit their own challenges and tutorials, fostering a community-driven content repository.

5. **Resource Library:**
   - **Documentation and Guides:** Access to comprehensive resources, including official Clojure documentation, guides, and best practices.
   - **External Resources:** Curated links to external blogs, videos, and courses that complement the learning experience.

**Technical Specifications:**

- **Backend Development:**
  - **Framework:** Use the Pedestal web framework for its support in creating data-oriented and event-driven web applications.
  - **Database:** User progress and submissions will be stored in a lightweight database, possibly using Datomic for its immutability and powerful query capabilities.

- **Frontend Development:**
  - **ClojureScript:** Leverage ClojureScript to bring Clojureâ€™s principles to the client-side, providing a seamless experience between the lessons and the coding environment.
  - **React Integration:** Use Reagent (a minimalistic ClojureScript interface to React) to build the user interfaces, ensuring reactive updates and a dynamic user experience.

- **Deployment:**
  - **Containerization:** Docker containers for easy deployment and scalability.
  - **Cloud Hosting:** Host the platform on cloud services like AWS or Heroku to ensure high availability and manage load effectively.

**Expected Outcomes:**
By the end of this project, learners should be able to understand the fundamentals of Clojure, apply functional programming techniques in various scenarios, and feel confident in their ability to use Clojure for both small scripts and large applications. The platform will also aim to build a community of Clojure enthusiasts who contribute to and benefit from the shared resources.
